In this data set, we see water levels for a sensor location in the Missisippi River Delta for a period of a few days.  Does this data set demonstrate climate change or not?   Why?   Hint: what confounding variables are present in this data set that might mask the effect of the variable which we are trying to evaluate?

[PreDeltaX_WaterLevel_Atchafalaya_WL10.xlsx](data_sets/PreDeltaX_WaterLevel_Atchafalaya_WL10.xlsx)

source of data:  https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/  has a wealth of climate change data.  We can discuss a particular example of it, water levels in the Missisippi Delta.  To do this, login to this site and click on "Find a DAAC" up on the top level, and select "ORNL" from the menu.  Within this menu, select "field campaigns", then Delta-X data set.  Within this, select Pre-Delta-X: Water Levels across Wax Lake Outlet, Atchafalaya Basin, LA, USA, 2016 .  This gets you a zip file containing 1.3 GB (Gigabytes) of tables from different locations and time.  We are looking at just one of these -- in the data/ subfolder, see PreDeltaX_WaterLevel_Atchafalaya_WL10.csv  .  I took this file and saved it as a Microsoft Excel .xlsx file so that I could format and add a graph, this workbook is attached below:
