This PBS Nova half-hour long video really digs into how statistics is used by police, and other crime-fighting agencies to combat crime, and shows some of the flaws in systems that have been developed to do this.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you look at this video because it's important to understand the limitations and pitfalls of statistics and how it can adversely affect real people if improperly used.

WARNING: this video may not have sound on Windows 11 laptops, at least not on mine, but [it works fine on any apple or android device according to PBS here](https://www.pbs.org/troubleshooting/).   I did get it to work by clicking on Start -> Settings (gear icon) -> System -> Sound and then I used the troubleshooter, it reinstalled Windows sound drivers and then sound started working.
