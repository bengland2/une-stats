This PBS Nova half-hour long video really digs into how statistics is used by police, and other crime-fighting agencies to combat crime, and shows some of the flaws in systems that have been developed to do this.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you look at this video because it's important to understand the limitations and pitfalls of statistics and how it can adversely affect real people if improperly used.
