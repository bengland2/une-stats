Here is a suggestion on what to do if you are about to take an exam, or if you are in an exam and quiz answers stop saving.  This is in part based on BrightSpace recommendations:

[What should I do if answers stop saving in the middle of a quiz](https://community.brightspace.com/s/article/What-should-I-do-if-answers-stop-saving-in-the-middle-of-a-quiz) 

One student saw this message in an exam:

"internet connection lost.   No longer saving answers"

This was corrected by having the student exit the browser COMPLETELY (all tabs).  To prevent this from costing you time, one possible solution is to write down the answers, either on paper or to a text file on your laptop, to exam questions and save any graphical plots as .png files on your laptop (usually right-click, then Save As Image...).  That way no time will be lost redoing exam questions, and you only need time to re-enter text and re-import plots.  

Before exiting your browser completely, bookmark important tabs so you can get back to them.

Brightspace recommends clearing your cache, but I'm suggesting a different procedure that is less extreme to start with:

- first, completely exit your browser (all tabs), and restart, login to brightspace again, see if the problem persists.
- if that doesn't work, try restarting your laptop and restart your browser.
- if that doesn't work, clear your browser cache (still finding out how to do that in safari), and restart your browser.
  - for Apple Safari, [see this link](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri47acf5d6/mac)
  - for Microsoft Edge browser, do this:
    - click on "..." in upper right corner
    - click on settings
    - click on "privacy, search and services"
    - go down to "clear browsing data"
    - if clearing cache doesn't work, try a different browser (Chrome for example)
  - for Chrome browser:
    - click on 3 vertical dots in upper right corner, then
    - Settings
    - Privacy and Security
    - Clear browsing data
    - Time range: All time
