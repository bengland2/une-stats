Here is a suggestion on what to do if you are in an exam and quiz answers stop saving, based on BrightSpace recommendations:

One student saw this message in an exam:

"internet connection lost.   No longer saving answers"

Brightspace recommends clearing your cache, but I'm suggesting a different procedure that is less extreme to start with:

- first, completely exit your browser (all tabs), and restart, login to brightspace again, see if the problem persists.
- if that doesn't work, try restarting your laptop and restart your browser.
- if that doesn't work, clear your browser cache (still finding out how to do that in safari), and restart your browser.
- for safari, [see this link](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri47acf5d6/mac)
- for edge, do this:
-- click on "..." in upper right corner
-- click on settings
-- click on "privacy, search and services"
-- go down to "clear browsing data"
-- if clearing cache doesn't work, try a different browser (Chrome for example)
