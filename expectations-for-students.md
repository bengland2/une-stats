This page lists expectations of UNE students in my course.   Some of these things shouldn't have to be said and most students already adhere to them, but this page is a way of reminding some students of how to make the best use of their opportunities in the class.   Unlike high school, no one is going to make you come to class or do homework. However, you or someone is paying for this course and if you do not put in the effort to do these things you will not learn the subject matter, which is the point of taking the course.   

# getting started with class

Before the second day of class, you need to:
* get textbook - I don't care if you use digital or paper
* get access to online resources needed for the class (typically Pearson or BrightSpace)
** The bookstore offers textbooks, you can get access to online resources if you buy a textbook using the code on your receipt, ask them
* login or ask for help during office hours or via e-mail/chat, if you cannot get in, before the second day of class.
* check content and announcements.
* read the course syllabus on learning objectives, schedule, grading and office hours.
* You can meet with me during office hours without arranging an appointment ahead of time, but there may be other students there ahead of you.  If so, we'll make alternate arrangements
* You can schedule appointments with me outside of office hours using Microsoft Calendar (available via okta.une.edu) - just click on the date and time, create an "invite" and send it to me.  It knows my schedule.

# during the semester

* I do take attendance.  Everyone misses a class occasionally due to sickness and other emergencies.   If I see someone is not attending class and not doing well in the course, lack of attendance will be taken into account in final grading.
* The sooner you get help with something you do not understand, the better!   That's why you pay for school!  It's not a shame to ask for help, if you are doing your part - school exists because you are not expected to know all the material at the start of class.  But if you put this off to the end of the semester, then it becomes unmanageable.  This kind of feedback also helps the teacher because chances are that other people are having similar challenges.
* The time to get good grades is at the start of the class.  If you are not doing well in a STEM class, typically the later parts of the class depend heavily on the earlier parts of the class, so you want to start strong.
* Late homeworks only hurt your grade not me personally.   Homework and in-class work are part of the process that gets your brain to absorb what we are teaching you.   It may feel like a lot of work at the time, but research has shown that it makes a huge difference, particularly if you spread it out and do it over time instead of all at once at the last minute.
** Cramming for an exam does not work well for anyone - you are better off studying for the exam all through the semester and getting a good night's sleep the night before.
* tutoring is available through SASC (in the common, 2nd floor) - but you have to arrange for it ahead of time.
* Check announcements in Brightspace for your class.  Anything I announce in class should be reflected in announcements as well, so if you miss class for any reason you should see something there.   However, do not e-mail me using Brightspace or Pearson's e-mail feature, as I may not see it - send normal e-mail to my UNE e-mail address.   You can try Chat using Microsoft Teams but I may not be monitoring it all the time.

## exams

* It is your responsibility to show up for exams in class.   Please let me know if you plan to miss an exam and arrange an alternate time to take it, *or else your grade will be a zero*.  If there was a health emergency for you or your family, notify the school as it affects other classes etc.  
* don't ask for help doing a problem in an exam - the exam is there to assess if you know how to do the work.   However, if the online system fails in any way, or if the problem description is not clear, please let me know ASAP.

# at the end of semester

* Please do not ask for a withdrawal at the end of the semester - you all usually know well before that whether you will get a satisfactory grade or not.  If you are not sure how you are doing, feel free to ask and I'll be glad to sit down with you and look at how it's going.  Also speak with your advisor if you are unsure what to do and what your intended degree's grade requirements are.
* All homework and quiz grades turn to zero at the end of the semester if you have not done them - look at Brightspace announcements for details of the exact date.   During the semester, undone homeworks and quizzes and exams are not counted in your "overall grade" -- otherwise everyone would start out with a zero :-{  But unless the title of the homework says "ungraded", then you have to do it.
