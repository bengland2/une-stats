Here's how to do basic least-squares line fitting to a data set in R, using data from the example 5.6 (also from example 5.2) on textbook page 228, which shows relationship between wine taste and tannin concentration.  The scatterplot there shows that the 2 variables have potential for least-squares linear regression.   To compute a least-squares linear regression line for the data and graph it with the data, upload the file from ex5_02.txt to R Cloud Studio, then import the dataset to obtain data frame *ex5_02*, then:

```
> attach(ex5_02)
> lmout = lm(y ~ x)
> summary(lmout)
 
Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)

First we attach the data frame so we can refer to its columns directly.  For example, we can use *y* instead of *ex5_02$y*.  Then we call *lm* to do the LSLR (Least-Squares Linear Regression) calculations, and save the result in a variable named *lmout*.    The tilde character ("~") between the 2 columns in the lm() call is indicating that we are trying to predict the y-variable, perceived astringency (taste) as a linear function of the x-variable column, tannin concentration. If we display *lmout* directly we get the line coefficients (slope and y-intercept), but if we use *summary(Lmout)* then we get much more information, including the coefficient of determination, *r^2* , which tells us what fraction of the variation in the *y* variable is explained by the line.

To graphically display both the data and the LSLR line generated by *lm()*, we use these base R graphics calls:

```
> plot(x, y)
> lines(x, lmout$fitted.values, col="green", lwd=5)
```

The *plot* function displays the scatterplot of x and y raw data.

The *lines* function displays the LSLR line result.   Note that *lwd=5* widens the line (default *lwd=1*).   The green color is a little easier to see in my opinion.  

Note that both of these functions require the x "vector" (list of numbers) to be passed before the y vector.

And then you get:
