# MAT150 - Statistics for Life Science

This directory contains code and documentation for MAT150.   The documentation was originally in BrightSpace but has been migrated here to make it more easily sharable.  The documentation will be in .md markdown format mostly.

click on <https://intro2r.com/> to see a tutorial on the R language, but this is a fairly large scope and we only need a small subset of what's in this document for the MAT150 course.   So here are some short task-oriented sections on how to do MAT150-specific tasks in R and Posit Cloud Studio (formerly R Studio).   We'll call it R Studio for short.   Tasks:
 
* ![how to start running Posit Cloud Studio](posit_cloud_setup.md)

* loading and saving data
  * how to load a data set from a file
  * ![how to generate a data set loadable by R Studio](how_to_generate_dataset.md)
  * ![how to export a data frame](submitting_data_frame.md)
  * ![how to export a graph](saving_graphs_from_R_Studio.md)

* R language
  * ![R data types you will need](minimal-R.md)
  * R function calls and how to use packages
  * ![numerical precision and accuracy](numerical_precision.md)
  * ![common R stats functions you will use](common_R_stats_functions.md)

* graphs for data visualization using base R graphics
  * ![raw data plots](raw_plots.md)
  * ![bar chart](bar_chart.md)
  * ![pie chart](pie_chart.md)
  * ![histogram](histogram.md)
  * boxplot
  * scatterplot
  * ![axis labels and title](axis_labels_and_title.md)
  * overlaying line on plot

* ![how to construct and graph frequency tables](frequency_tables.md)

* ![correlation](correlation.md)

* ![Least-Squares Linear Regression (LSLR)](lslr.md)
